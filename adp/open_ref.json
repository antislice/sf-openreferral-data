One of the tools you can use to estimate your eligibility for federal student financial assistance is the Financial Aid Estimator Tool – FAFSA4caster – which is available online at www.fafsa4caster.ed.gov.  You may have heard that if you have been convicted of a felony, you are not eligible to receive financial aid. This is not necessarily true. A student convicted for the possession or sale of illegal drugs may have eligibility suspended if the offense occurred while the student was receiving federal student aid (grants, loans, or work-study). When you complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), you will be asked whether you had a drug conviction for an offense that occurred while you were receiving federal student aid. If the answer is yes, you will be provided a special worksheet to help you determine whether your conviction affects your eligibility for federal student aid. You may preview the worksheet in the FAFSA Information section at www.studentaid.ed.gov/pubs. If you have been convicted of a forcible or nonforcible sexual offense, and you are subject to an involuntary civil commitment upon completion of a period of incarceration for that offense, you are ineligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant.",

Second, they must have the willingness to resolve and change their substance abusing behavior. Third, there needs to be an understanding and reconciliation of any conflict within themselves, their families and cultural traditions. Finally, they need to develop abilities and skills in managing their lives in the social, economic and political reality of their environment and community. The AARS-residential is a therapeutic community which recognizes the need for providing structure, support and opportunity within a multi-cultural environment. It is a highly structured environment with defined boundaries, both moral and ethical.

CRJW calls the community to set aside pre-judgments about women and men in prison in order to work together to accompany families torn apart by the crime and the criminal justice system; create awareness about the negative impacts of incarceration on children and families; and advocate for programs and policies that restore relationships.  CJRW re-weaves the web of relationships that have been torn apart by crime and the policies of the criminal justice system. Get on the Bus is a program of The Center for Restorative Justice Works. Get On The Bus brings children and their guardians/caregivers from throughout the state of California to visit their mothers and fathers in prison. An annual event, Get On The Bus offers free transportation for the children and their caregivers to the prison, provides travel bags for the children, comfort care bags for the caregivers, a photo of each child with his or her parent, and meals for the day (breakfast, snacks on the bus, lunch at the prison, and dinner on the way home) — all at no cost to the children’s family. On the bus trip home, following a four-hour visit, each child receives a teddy bear with a letter from their parent and post-event counseling.  www.crjw.us     www.getonthebus.usNo referral needed.  Applications are received from the incarcerated parent at select institutions.  Call for more info..Inter-Faith.",

Its philosophy is that the people with the problems can teach themselves to become the solution. The program requires a minimum two-year commitment, and many individuals stay for longer. The Delancey Street Foundation Los Angeles facility is located near midtown, right off the Hollywood freeway. The facility, housing approximately 300 residents, was constructed as a 220 room hotel; the Mission style building complex includes a huge ballroom for catering events for up to 500 people, with smaller catering rooms as well. The buildings surround a large 8,000 square foot tropical garden with cascading waterfalls. Residents have completely renovated the building since we bought it in 1993. In order to make the hotel more of a home, residents turned the guest rooms into living units ranging from dorms for the newcomers into small apartments as residents earn their way to more spacious living quarters, and opened up the dining area to 6,000 square feet for resident meals. Delancey Street-Los Angeles also has a 50,000 square foot warehouse Business Complex located in Montebello. This complex houses a number of Delancey Training Schools including Moving & Trucking, Automotive, Auto Body Shop, Warehouse Shipping and Receiving, Terrarium, Ceramics and Iron Handcraft Works and Sales.  www.delanceystreetfoundation.orgNo referrals needed.

The second floor of the building is dedicated to the Family Transitional Housing program, which provides shelter and a wide range of transformative programs for up to 11 families at a time. Families may stay for up to two years, during which time they receive intensive support services and individualized case management. Parents are required to participate in Kids First, COTS' 12-week parenting skills training, and in Rent Right, a 9-week course in financial literacy and housing search. More than 70% of families graduate into permanent housing and independent stable lives. The 100-bed Emergency Shelter for Single Adults is located on the first floor of the Mary Isaak Center. Services include food, clothing, showers, access to phones and a messaging system, access to computers, transportation assistance, mental health and chemical dependency recovery support, job skills training, and assistance in obtaining employment and/or public benefits. Residents may stay for up to six months and more than 50% graduate into either transitional or permanent housing.
