In addition they also have tutoring programs during the school year. They run a Student Center for high school and college placement support, and other service learning programs.The Aim High Headlands Environmental Home (AH-HEH) Program is a week-long environmental education experience for Aim High's graduating 9th graders. As part of Aim High's five-week summer program, 9th grade students from each site dedicate one week to learning what it means to be stewards of the park. Under the guidance of the GGNRA's Habitat Restoration Team, students undertake restoration projects including trail maintenance, removal of invasive plants and monitoring and propagation of native species, providing more than 1,500 volunteer hours to the park annually. Students also camp overnight, hike, visit the beach, take solos (periods of quiet reflection), journal, speak and listen to the group at Council, work in small teams, and learn about the ecology and the history of the region from park experts and naturalists.Camps:
Inner-city middle school kids have an opportunity to participate in a challenging, supportive, and tuition-free summer school program. This isn't really a camp but rather a summer education program. Students focus on math, science, humanities, and project-based learning in the mornings, while afternoons are spent on art and mural projects, biking and bike repair, cooking, music, and more. Aim High also organizes field trips, cultural programs, and park stewardship activities at Tennessee Valley Native Plant Nursery in Marin.2013 Summer Session:Dates: June 24–July 26Days/Times: Mondays through Fridays, 8am–3:30pmCost: FREE

It also prepped them for the following grade. The class offered assessments and students had a small amount of homework as well. Both of my kids liked the program and the fee was the right price—FREE.""""Both of my kids have been part of the program. The kids in the program are focused, participate in the projects, go on field trips like Chabot Planetarium, a ropes course in the Presidio, and the Exploratorium.  There is a talent show, spirit week, a play, a variety of enrichment activities in the afternoon to choose from like dance, swimming, drama, basketball, science, and more. Once your child is in the program they are in until they enter ninth grade. They must attend all five weeks of classes."" —Chris, mother of two","Matt Reno, Director of Operations",,,,,,,,,mreno@aimhigh.org,,2013-05-30,"Activities\Classes\Science and Nature, Activities\Classes\Academics and Tutoring, Community\Neighborhood and Community Organizations\Youth Clubs, Out of School Time\Camps\Academics, Out of School Time\Camps\General Day, Out of School Time\Camps\Science and Nature,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ",,,,,"   ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    "
