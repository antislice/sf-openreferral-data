Whether it's Spanish, Mandarin, Italian, French, or German, parents in San Francisco are betting that early exposure to a second or third language has tremendous cognitive and social benefits for a child. And those are solid bets. Here are some things to think about when considering a language immersion program for your child: 1. The goal of an immersion program is to achieve fluency in the second language (reading, writing, speaking) while mastering content in both languages.2.  Most programs conduct 80-100% of instruction in the target language in the early grades (K-2) then shift to 50/50 (grades 3-5) and back to English for middle school, where a third language is often added. Preschools often do 100% instruction in the target language. 3. Research shows that bilingual children may start slower out of the gate, but by 5th grade achieve proficiency in content areas in both languages and often have increased vocabulary in the native language. 4. A common concern is that introducing a second language at an early age may delay English development but research shows that the immersion experience actually enhances English learning, albeit with a slight delay. 5. Research also shows that multilingual children see benefits in non-verbal problem-solving and flexible thinking. The process of trying to understand a teacher's instruction in another language makes them try harder and in turn positively impacts their cognitive development. 6. Immersion programs emphasize the transfer of a new language, as well as the cultural norms associated with the language, which builds understanding of the world and global citizenship. 7. Children and their parents need not be proficient in the target language. Parents can support their children by being enthusiastic and should speak and read to their kids in their native language, which helps increase the pace of new language acquisition. 8. If you have a familial or cultural connection to a particular language, a language immersion program is a great way to spark your child's interest in making a similar link. 9. In an increasingly small and interdependent world, multilingualism gives children the confidence and skills to communicate with different people and adapt to a variety of places. 10. It only takes 2-3 years in an immersion program for a child to achieve proficiency in the new language. To sustain fluency, research shows that exposure thru age 12 is best. Whether you pursue it or move on, your child will have two ways to say or think about the same thing.   About the AuthorClaudia Volpi is the President of the Board at La Scuola Internazionale di San Francisco, an independent Italian-immersion preschool and elementary school.
