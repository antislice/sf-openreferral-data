CYWD programs offer young women a way out of repeated incarceration and into self-sufficiency, wholeness, and advocacy. A large component of the work is self-care and healing. All CYWD programs promote wellness and healthier living. Programs offered include Sister\u2019s Rising, an internship that combines skill development with a wellness and and empowerment curriculum. Each year Sisters Rising hires 17 young women for a paid internship that incorporates healing, skills development, political education, community organizing and reintegration. The Girls Detention Advocacy Program (GDAP) supports incarcerated and previously incarcerated young women in developing the skills and coping mechanisms they need to successfully reenter the community. GDAP offers weekly educational workshops in San Francisco\u2019s Juvenile Hall and weekly post-release support groups to young women and girls leaving the system.\ufffc"
