The Crisis Residential Program offers an intensive, 24-hour therapeutic environment that works closely with local psychiatric emergency clinics to provide primary diversion from, and an alternative to psychiatric in-patient confinement. The Transitional Residential Treatment Program houses clients between 3 months and 1-year depending on the program, so each client receives individualized support to maintain their stability and to work on long-term goals. The Supported Living Program provides case management services and crisis intervention with two housing options: cooperative living apartments and independent living apartments."
