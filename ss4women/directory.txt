        SERVICES FOR PARENTS WHO NEED SUPPORT, SERVICES FOR
                  PARENTS WHO NEED HELP PAYING SUPPORT

   Financial support and parental involvement determine what a child has in life, what that
   child can do, and who that child will become. The San Francisco Department of Child Support
 Services provides case management services to parents, guardians, and caretakers of minor children,
 regardless of marital status or income. Our services include the location of parents, the establishment
    of paternity and support orders, modification of existing child support orders, and enforcement of
support obligations. All our services are available to you for a nominal fee of $25 per year and all your
information is kept confidential. Come in and talk with our staff or call us and our staff will come meet
 you anywhere in San Francisco! Remember that we are here to help, not to hurt. Take charge and let
                 us work with you. REMEMBER THAT CHILD SUPPORT IS LIFE SUPPORT!

   Help a parent, and you help a child as well. We also offer services to parents who need help
paying support. Our Transitions SF program can provide PAID job opportunities and FREE programs to
 qualifying applicants. Our programs can help you get a job, get training, and deal with any obstacles
   you might have to paying support. For more information on Transitions SF, call (415) 356-2942.

representing an important means by which individuals can access nonprofit and
government services available to residents within the City and County of San Francisco

services that are designed for and sensitive to the unique needs of women and girls.

Although every effort has been made to verify the information for accuracy, changes in
personnel and services do occur. Please contact the Department on the Status of Women
immediately with any modifications, additions, or deletions to the services listed in this
Directory. Contact us at dosw@sfgov.org or (415) 252-2570.

                     development with a wellness and and empowerment curriculum. Each
                     year Sisters Rising hires 17 young women for a paid internship that
                     incorporates healing, skills development, political education,

 Services Provided   Youth Leadership Institute (YLI) provides support opportunities for
                     young people to develop and build their leadership skills while they
                     address the impact of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and other prevention-
                     related issues in their communities.
                     YLI offers young people opportunities to create and implement
                     projects using an environmental prevention framework. This approach
                     identifies and addresses messages and policies that push a dynamic
                     role in the health of young people.
                     Historically, projects have focused on preventing the use of alcohol,
                     tobacco, and other drugs among young people.
