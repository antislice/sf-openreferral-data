We envision helping to inspire a shift from a society of overworked, isolated people to groups of interactive, creative and responsive people. We see this shift occurring through the informed work of our graduates, faculty and students in schools, community centers, theaters, and health facilities, and in classes, performances, and informal gatherings on-site at MOC.		art; classes / courses; creativity; dance; health; theatre	01/31/1999	02/23/2014	acow	director@movingoncenter.org	http://www.movingoncenter.org

Network of Bay Area Worker Cooperatives		NoBAWC			POBox 24953	Oakland	CA	94623	(510) 482-4547		NoBAWC (pronounced "no boss")  is a grassroots organization of democratic workplaces dedicated to building workplace democracy in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.^^As the name implies, NoBAWC is comprised primarily of worker cooperatives.  A worker cooperative is an enterprise that produces goods, distributes goods and/or provides services and is owned and controlled by its worker-owners.  Ownership of a worker cooperative is vested solely with the worker-owners on an equal basis.  Moreover, worker-owners control the resources of the cooperative and the work process.  Each worker-owner has equal decision-making power and ultimate authority rests with the worker-owners as a whole.  Worker control can be exercised directly or indirectly by worker-owners.  If exercised indirectly, members of representative decision-making bodies (e.g. a Board of Directors) must be elected by the worker-owners and be subject to removal by the worker-owners.		collectives; cooperatives; labor; networking	06/30/2002	09/07/2013	acow	info@nobawc.org	http://www.nobawc.org

While NAIS’s purported goal of disease containment appears to be beneficial, the requirement for American citizens to register privately-owned property for tracking and monitoring purposes has very serious implications for our privacy, rights and freedoms.		agriculture; government; privacy; surveillance	02/12/2006	09/28/2013	surf		http://www.stopanimalid.org
